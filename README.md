# checksum_scripts

## Bash scripts Usage

### check_dir
./check_dir /path/to/directory /path/to/second/directory

### check_file
./check_file /path/to/location/file1.txt /path/to/locate/file2.txt

Integrity check is based off of file and directory CONTENTS. For my convenience and the convenience
of others, I am not taking into consideration file or directory names as well as the resulting hash.
